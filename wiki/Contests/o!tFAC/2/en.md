## Ruleset

### Contest rules

- **Contestants will submit a mapset of any licensed song they choose from [this list](https://bns.are-la.me/2XSGmvB.txt) of osu!'s [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists).**
- **Songs must not exceed a length of 4:30.** There will a bit of leeway in cases where the song is really close to the 4:30 mark.
- **The map must be an osu!taiko map.**
- **The mapset must include TWO difficulties: the top difficulty + a Muzukashii difficulty.** Any entry that is missing a difficulty will be disqualified.
- **All submissions must be rankable.** No beatmap submitted must be intentionally unrankable. Mistakes happen and points will be deducted for them, but this is a regular mapping contest, not Aspire. (You are allowed to ignore spread rules for the sake of this contest.)
- **Maps must NOT be uploaded/shared with others before judging and results are announced.** Sharing your entry publicly by any means before the results are announced will get your entry disqualified, no questions asked.
- **Submissions will not be accepted after the deadlines.** No exceptions.

### Judging criteria

- **Judge's Impression (5 Points):** Points will be assigned based on what the judge thinks about your map.
- **Ranking Criteria (5 Points):** Points will be assigned based on how well the map abides by the ranking criteria.
- **Structure (10 Points):** Points will be assigned based on how well the map is internally designed (consistency, concept introduction, etc.).
- **Relevance (10 Points):** Points will be assigned based on how well the map represents the song and how well it plays.
- **Creativity (10 Points):** Points will be assigned based on how the submission uses creative and fitting elements to make itself stand out.
- **Muzukashii Score (10 Points):** Points will be assigned based on how well the Muzukashii difficulty is mapped based on rankability, structure, relevance, and creativity.

## Notes

[^prizes-ranked]: 2 Beatmap Nominators from the contest's organisation team (either ![][flag_AR] [Axer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7299864), ![][flag_DE] [Greenshell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8693851), ![][flag_TN] [Hivie](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/14102976), or ![][flag_US] [Nifty](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4956097)) will mod and push the map to Ranked if the mapper wants to, and **if they get the necessary difficulties to form a rankable spread when needed.**
